CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Josh Palmer

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |       X       |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

* Have at least one screen

* Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

* Phillip Lackner Youtube
* Android Studio documentation (https://developer.android.com/guide)
* Resources from my CSE222 Kotlin language class
* Mobile dev society peers

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I want to iterate several times, aka build it at least a few times over so I get really familiar with what I'm doing. The problem is: that takes a bit of time and a lot of help. Luckily, we have AI these days, and I'll be using it as a personal tutor on these assignments.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I'm really not sure at all. It may be an events feed, a weather app, a calculator, or a suite of minor tools like flashlight and compass gui. I'll try these ideas as part of my multi-iteration structure and see how it goes.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

Mostly Thursdays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. I'm free most often during the middayt. Mobile development society is a great time to do this kind of work as well.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

Technical risk: Android studio is a piece of work
Mitigation: Using a different editor, maybe even trying out flutter (or doing iOS)
Behavioral risk: Lack of drive & mental block due to focus issues
Mitigation: Pick a project I'm really passionate about

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date | Start Time | IM or TP | Description                                   | Hours:Minutes |
|------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 6/4  | 7pm        | IM       | Starting Project                              | 3:30          |
| 6/5  | 4pm        | IM       | Fixing button laayouts and general appearance | 1:45          |

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/josh-palmerk/calculatorAppAndroid

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/nEQhfFs1UDE

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    | Response |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     | Yes      |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?| Yes      |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   | Yes      |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  | Yes      |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

I did not complete a stretch challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

I did not change the module out of pure spite and stubbornness toward Android studio.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         | Total Hours:Minutes |
|-----------------|---------------------|
|Individual Module| 11:15               |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

I keep trying to sprint through the sprints, meaning I try to do it all in a few large sessions rather than keeping it consistent throughout the two week period. This keeps causing a lot of ain but I do it out of necessity. I'm so far behind with everything in my life right now that it's frankly absurd. I deserve to be fired from my job if I'm honest. It's that bad.

I could make things a bit better next sprint after I catch up a bit on my work. I have reason to believe that I can actually catch up now, some of my responsibilities have lessened as of a few days ago.
